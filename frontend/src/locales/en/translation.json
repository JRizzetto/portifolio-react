    "text": "My name is Jefferson Wellington Bonfim Rizzetto, and I am a front-end developer with a solid technical background and hands-on experience building web applications. I hold a degree in Electrical Engineering and began my professional career working with technology and computer maintenance. Over the years, I have also worked in roles that required strong analytical skills, including government sales, commercial communication, and engineering as a technical lead. In 2024, I decided to fully transition my career into software development, combining logic, creativity, and problem-solving. Since then, I have been specializing in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, while also developing practical projects that integrate front-end with back-end using Node.js and MySQL databases. Currently, I am seeking my first opportunity as a front-end developer, where I can apply my knowledge, continue to grow technically, and contribute to well-structured, high-performance products focused on user experience.",
